As I rest my eyes\
the Moon glides\
through our boundless sky.

My mind begins to wander\
through the gloom\
of the velvet shroud.

From the darkness\
and disparity,\
in the midst of the night,\
a gift manifests.

Swirling beams of light\
full of radiant lucidity,\
Of matter and energy,\
Intertwined with clouds\
of gas and dust.

A spark ignites,\
A flame erupts,\
The gas and the dust\
abruptly combust.

Through this destruction\
hope is created,\
Joy comes forth,\
Your hand reaches to me.

Seen from Earth\
sewn into the velvet sky,\
A brilliant orb of life,\
Born from you and I.
