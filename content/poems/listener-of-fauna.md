A songbird flies past me\ (Syn for “flies”/“past”)
tweeting their lovely tune.\ (Syn for “lovey”)
They guide me around all\ (Syn for “around”)
which is ill-fated.

At the end of our journey\
they sung their final tune,\
In a language long forgotten.

(Rewrite this, maybe some synonyms)
I did not understand\
the sounds of guidance.\
But my soul could decipher\
the destiny now chosen.

I traveled along their azimuth,\
To the path they once guided,\
Until the view of radiance,\
Cleaned the seraph eyes,\
And left all to transpire.
