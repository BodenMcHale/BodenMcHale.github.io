You are the burning embers,\
Sewn into the velvet sky.

When your embers blaze,\
Into a raging flame,\
A symbol will be born.

From the darkness and silence,\
A new soul begins to breathe.\
From the empty vastness,\
A spark of joy will burn.\
A flicker of hope will shine.

You are the shining beacon of hope,\
I will always cherish.

Your golden rays will sow,\
through each droplet in our clouds.\
They will gently lay warmth,\
with their beloved glow.

You are a merciful touch upon my skin,\
a welcoming warmth to bask in.

When I close my eyes,\
I will see the world anew.
