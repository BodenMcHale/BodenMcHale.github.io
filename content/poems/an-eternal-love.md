I love you more than leaves love the sun,\
More than the rain loves the thirsty earth,\
More than the waves love the oceanâ€™s depth,\
More than the stars love the midnight sky.

I love you more than life itself,\
More than all the world could ever give,\
More than all the dreams that I could dream,\
More than all the hopes that I could hope.

I love you with a love that is eternal,\
A love that is beyond all measure,\
A love that is as vast as the universe,\
A love that will last forever.
