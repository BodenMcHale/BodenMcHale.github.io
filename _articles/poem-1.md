I love you more than leaves love the sun,
More than the rain loves the thirsty earth,
More than the waves love the ocean’s depth,
More than the stars love the midnight sky.

I love you more than life itself,
More than all the world could ever give,
More than all the dreams that I could dream,
More than all the hopes that I could hope.

I love you with a love that is eternal,
A love that is beyond all measure,
A love that is as vast as the universe,
A love that will last forever.
