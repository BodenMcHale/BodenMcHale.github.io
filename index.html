      Welcome to my personal poetry site!
      <br><br>
      I'm a poet who loves to write about the things that matter to me, from my fianc√© to the world around me. 
      <br>
      I hope you enjoy reading my poems as much as I enjoy writing them.
      <br><br>
      I'm always learning and growing as a poet, and I'm excited to share my work with you. I hope you'll find something that speaks to you.
    </p>
